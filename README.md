<h1>Random Effects</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is based off of the textbook "Extending the Linear Model with R" by Julian J. Faraway. These are exercises completed based off of Chapter 10: Random Effects. I use ggplot2 to visualize the data and lme4 to fit the random effects models. Prediction intervals are computed through simulation while setting seeds to maintain the same prediction interval. The pbkrtest package is used to produce parametric bootstrap and kenward-rogers tests, while analyzing what each of these tests mean for the data. The package RLRsim is used to test the significance of the random effects.
